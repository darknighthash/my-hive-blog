# my-hive-blog

## Project Introduction
**my-hive-blog** is a blogging platform based on the Hive blockchain, supported by `@hiveio/dhive`. This project is built with the React, Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS tech stack, focused on displaying articles from the Hive blockchain.

## Features
- Browse articles from the Hive blockchain
- Support for filtering articles by time, tags, etc.
- Responsive design that adapts to different devices
- Styled with TailwindCSS for a sleek and optimized look
- Supports one-click deployment to **Vercel**, **Netlify**, and other platforms

## Tech Stack
- **React**: To build the user interface
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that improves development experience
- **TypeScript**: To improve code maintainability and development efficiency
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid responsive design
- **@hiveio/dhive**: A JavaScript SDK for interacting with the Hive blockchain and retrieving articles

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Node.js and npm
Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed. It is recommended to use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to install and manage your Node.js versions.

```bash
# Install nvm (if not already installed)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

# Install the latest LTS version of Node.js
nvm install --lts

# Switch to the latest LTS version
nvm use --lts

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone this project from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darknighthash/my-hive-blog.git
cd my-hive-blog
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
This project uses Vite as the build tool and depends on `@hiveio/dhive` for blockchain interactions. Use the following commands to install all dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using yarn
yarn install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and configure the Hive blockchain API settings:

```bash
# Example .env file

VITE_HIVE_NODE=https://api.hive.blog, https://api.hivekings.com, https://anyx.io, https://api.openhive.network
VITE_HIVE_USERNAME=your_hive_name
VITE_HIVE_CREATED=your_hive_create 
```

### 5. Start the Development Environment
After installing the dependencies and configuring the environment variables, you can start the development environment:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Or using yarn
yarn dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`, and you can view the local development version in your browser.

## Deployment

### 1. Vercel Deployment
Vercel is a recommended platform for Vite projects and supports fast, one-click deployments:

1. Visit the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/) and log in
2. Click **"New Project"** and import your GitHub repository
3. In **Framework Preset**, select `Vite`
4. In **Environment Variables**, add your `.env` configurations
5. Click **"Deploy"** to start the deployment process

### 2. Netlify Deployment
Netlify is another excellent platform for hosting static sites. Itâ€™s ideal for deploying frontend applications:

1. Visit the [Netlify website](https://www.netlify.com/) and log in
2. Select **"New site from Git"** and import your GitHub repository
3. In **Build Command**, enter:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. In **Publish Directory**, choose `dist`
5. Add your `.env` configurations in **Environment Variables**
6. Click **"Deploy site"** to start the deployment process
